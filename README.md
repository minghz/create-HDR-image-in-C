The only important file is image.c

All other files are sample images of different exposure levels.
They can be used as input to the compiled program (a.out)

Read image.c main() function to understand what it is doing.

To simply run, do:
./a.out

It will currently take in a.ppm, b.ppm, and c.ppl and spit out rendered.ppm.
